PAIRR ChatGPT Privacy Protocol (2024-2025)

STEP 1: Set Up ChatGPT
●	Log into ChatGPT (if you do not already have an account, create a free account using your email) 
●	Open a “New Chat”
●	Privacy: To protect your privacy and intellectual property, please use ChatGPT in “incognito mode”: “By default, OpenAI will use the messages you send to ChatGPT to ‘train and improve’ its models. But users have the power to stop this from happening by using the platforms’ incognito mode. To activate it, open ChatGPT in your browser, click your username on the left, go to Settings, and next to Data Controls click Show. Once there, turn off the Chat History & Training toggle switch.”
